### Electronic

To create the scheamtic of the project, we used Eagle. Eagle is a very powerful tool made by Autodesk and can be linked with Fusion 360 which is really useful. 

Thanks to this tool, we made the following schematic. If you want more detail about it, a .sch file is available in the electronic folder.
